# YouTube to Webflow Synchronization Flow

This project provides a Prefect flow to synchronize YouTube videos with Webflow CMS items. The flow fetches YouTube videos, checks if they exist in BunnyCDN, and then creates or updates Webflow CMS items accordingly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Prefect
- Required API credentials and configurations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your configuration file in `cfg/cfg.py`.

## Configuration

Ensure you have a configuration file `cfg/cfg.py` that provides necessary configurations such as API keys, paths, and other settings.

## Running the Flow

To run the YouTube to Webflow synchronization flow, execute the following command:
    ```sh
    python flow.py
    ```

## Flow Details

The flow consists of the following main tasks:

1. **Load Configurations**: Loads the necessary configurations from `cfg/cfg.py`.
2. **Fetch YouTube Videos**: Fetches YouTube videos using the YouTube API.
3. **Fetch Existing Webflow Items**: Retrieves existing items from Webflow CMS.
4. **Process Videos**: For each video:
    - Checks if the video exists in BunnyCDN.
    - If not, downloads and uploads the video to BunnyCDN.
    - Creates or updates the Webflow CMS item with the video details.

## Logging

The flow uses Python's `logging` module to log debug information. Ensure that logging is configured properly to capture these logs.

## Additional Information

For more details on the individual tasks and their implementations, refer to the `flow.py` file in the repository.
